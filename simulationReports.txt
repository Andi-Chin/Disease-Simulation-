assumptions:
masks cut down chance of infection by about 65%
the infection radius of covid-19 is about 1.8 meters, or around 4 body lengths.

tests & results:

average transmission rate:
	peak infected: 295
	deaths: 37
	looking at second wave of infections with very small chance of losing immunity:
		total deaths: 70
		average infected at any time: 24
		kept going for a very long time, almost double the number of deaths at the initial viral outbreak

	with quarantine:
		peak infected: 50
		average infected: 25
		death: 20
		
	with quarantine social distancing:
		peak infected: 3
		deaths: 0
			

	without shopping:
		peak infected: 290
		deaths: 30

	quarantine when 10% of the population is infected, social distance when 30% infected:
		peak infected: 98
		average infected: 42
		deaths: 14
	
	social distance when 10% of the population is infected, quarantine when 30% infected:
		peak infected: 101
		average infected: 45
		deaths: 14

	two communities quarantines and social distances while one doesn't:
		peak infected: 104
		deaths: 11
	one communities distance, quarantine, no shoppers while the other two don't:
		peak infection: 187
		deaths: 17

	
what happens if people start wearing masks:
	(infection chances reduced by 65%)
	peak infection: 259
	deaths: 27
	the complexity, or growth rate is the same as not wearing masks

what happens when people follow all guidelines most of the time but have 100% infection rate:
	peak infected: 89
	deaths: 18
	

what happens when the chance of losing immunity is raised by very little:
	the graph keeps going for a much longer time, killing almost 70% of the population before stopping

social distance and quarantine when more than 10% is infected, but life them off when less than that.
	observation: lots of peaks, the cycle only dies down when more people have recovered and are immunue
	peak infected: 85
	death: 35
